Built My First AI Automation!

I created an end-to-end workflow where user inputs are collected through a form, stored automatically in Airtable, assigned ratings based on profession, and finally processed by an AI agent that generates a personalized one-line poem for each user.

The entire process now runs with zero manual effort — fully automated and AI-powered.
Excited for the next build!
