I’m excited to share my first successful AI automation project!
I built a complete workflow where:

1. Users submit their details (name, looks, profession) through a form.

2. The data is automatically synced to Airtable.

3. A rating is assigned based on their profession using predefined logic.

4. A custom AI Agent then generates a unique one-line poem for each user using their profession and appearance.

5. The poem is instantly added back to Airtable.

This project removed all manual data entry and content creation, making the entire pipeline smart, fast, and fully automated.
Also we can get data from the public as well by provinding them the production url.

Proud of this milestone and excited to work on more AI-driven solutions!
